## üìÑ Abstract  
Simulating urban mobility scenarios is crucial for researchers in fields like urban planning, traffic optimization, CO2 emissions analysis, and performance evaluation of protocols for connected vehicles. This paper explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) within the SUMO-VEINS-OMNeT++ framework to address traffic light assignment problems.  

The methodology involves:  
1. **Simulation Setup**: Using SUMO for microscopic traffic simulations and OMNeT++ for communication protocol analysis.  
2. **Integration**: Leveraging the SUMO-VEINS-OMNeT++ framework to interact with simulations in real-time.  
3. **Machine Learning**: Training an SVM to classify and optimize traffic light assignments.  

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in classifying traffic scenarios and optimizing traffic light assignments.
